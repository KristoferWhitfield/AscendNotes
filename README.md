### Description:
When users visit the [Note App](https://ascendnotes.fly.dev/) they are prompted to begin entering notes they'd like to save. Users can then Pin important notes, 
update note content as needed and delete each individual note.

### Most Challenging part
FrontEnd:
- The most challenging part of developing this app was realizing we had to go back and make changes in order to write good test. Through this, we understood the importance of components in relation to creating test.

Backend:
- The most challenging part of developing this app was keeping up with the schedule and tickets while being sick and having such a short deadline to meet.

### Most enjoyable part:
FrontEnd:
- The most enjoyable part of developing this app was STYLING of course! Us Front end Devs love to make it cool and fancy! We learned multiple ways to apply style and incorporate it into the apps functionality.

Backend:
- The most enjoyable part of developing this app was witnessing the end result. It's truly rewarding to see the calls working and the expected data return

### How would we improve this project?
- In a perfect world we would add usser authentication for multiple users to use the apps with individual accounts. Additionally, We would like to see more options for how to organixe notes in catagories and sort through the ones we want to see.

We believe we worked efficiently from day one by breaking down responsibilities and tasks among the group, dedicating time each day to the project. The frontend and backend teams maintained excellent communication, ensuring a smooth workflow through our project manager. We utilized GitHub's backlog to issue tickets to each team, adhering to our schedule with the help of Notion and Slack for organizing notes and communication. We collaborated and supported each other whenever needed.

Our [Note App Testing Documentation](https://www.notion.so/Ascend-Notes-Documentation-29f35195934c41ccb28cb9b920610432?pvs=4) is clear and consise! Writing our documentation helped us better understand how to build for testing and clearly articulate our test to other devs.
